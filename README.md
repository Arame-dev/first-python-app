# XOR Encryption and Decryption with Python

This Python program demonstrates how XOR (exclusive OR) operation can be used to encrypt and decrypt a numeric value. The XOR operation is a simple yet effective technique in basic cryptography. Additionally, a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is included to automate testing the code.

## How It Works

The program uses the following logic:

1. **Encryption**: The XOR operation is performed between a `number` and a `key` to generate an encrypted value.
   - Formula: `Encrypted = Number ^ Key`

2. **Decryption**: The XOR operation is applied again between the `Encrypted` value and the same `key` to retrieve the original `number`.
   - Formula: `Decrypted = Encrypted ^ Key`

### Example

- **Input Values**:  
  - `Number = 54` (`110110` in binary)  
  - `Key = 106` (`1101010` in binary)  

- **Encryption**:  
  - `Encrypted = Number ^ Key = 54 ^ 106 = 92` (`1011100` in binary)

- **Decryption**:  
  - `Decrypted = Encrypted ^ Key = 92 ^ 106 = 54` (`110110` in binary)

### Output

The program outputs:
1. The original number and key.
2. The encrypted value.
3. The decrypted value to verify correctness.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the execution of the Python program on every push.

### CI Workflow File

```yaml
name: Python first-testing

run-name: ${{ github.actor }} write CI/CD for app ðŸš€

on: push

jobs:
  Test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set-up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
            python-version: "3.x"
      - name: Display python version
        run: python --version 
      - name: Run app
        run: python ./Encrypting.py

```
### Key Workflow Steps

1. Checkout Repository: Clones the repository containing the code.
2. Set up Python: Ensures the latest version of Python 3.x is available.
3. Display Python Version: Outputs the Python version for debugging.
4. Run App: Executes the Encrypting.py script.
